lvl 1: the tutorial, this level showcases double jumps and wall climbing as well as having a lock and key puzzle - made by Both
lvl 2: meant to get the player to dash and also introduces buttons and gates - Will
lvl 3: combines the gate and lock and key puzzles and adds moving platforms - Max

level select:
pushing the 1, 2, 3 keys takes you to each corresponding level. 4 takes you to the secret level

Secret Level:
in lvl 1 there is a secret door that takes you straight to lvl 3 and also has a small key to access the gem for a multi-level puzzle, the way to get there is to jump up past the first door. 
in lvl 3 continuing up towards the vines takes you to the secret level where you can collect the secret gem, if collect it will appear on a pedestal at the end 

EC included:
Double jumping and wall jumping(max 3 wall jumps)
Alternate player movement(ground pound and dash)
Ways for player to die/be incapacitated(spikes)
Puzzles, lock-and-key puzzle
Dynamic level Elements
Secret levels
Moving platforms
Juicy juice(player flashes red when attempting to double jump or wall jump they cannot, and pitch of the walljump noise increases with each consecutive jump)

Notes:
- make sure to hold a or d against a wall to cling to it, reducing gravity and allowing the player to double jump 
- physics can be buggy, we couldn't really figure out why
- use 1, 2, 3, and 4 to switch between levels(4 is level 3s secret area)
- level 1 has a secret area that requires dashing and then jumping right after to gain extra height, as dashing disables gravity
for its duration, there you can find a key and a door that allows you to go directly to level 3
- level 3s secret area saves the data of the previous level, acting more as an extension
- the gem seen in level 3s secret area requires the secret key from level 1 to get
